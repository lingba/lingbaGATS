  <h1><strong>What for?</strong></h1>
  <P>Actually, I was a repeater.
    I had to study Korean exam one more time to go university.
    I was very upset about my result. I couldn’t live like general person.
    I mean I was almost crazy. Time marches on and I went to Japan to heal myself.
    And I became general person and was ready to restart.
    I planned to watch math internet lecture for 20 days.
    And I was pushing the print button and my mom came and said “Lingba, why don’t you just go Malaysia to study?”
    I friged for a moment and was very confused.
    Actually, I didn’t believe what my mom said.
    But my mom and dad searched very hard about Malaysia going abroad to study program,
    and called to some academy.
    Eventually, I will go Singapore to study.
    And before I go, I will level up my English skill in Philippines.
