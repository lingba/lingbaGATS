  <h1><strong>Philippines</strong></h1>
  <P> I’m very nervous now because I have a terrible English skill. In Philippines academy, I can only use English and I must study English all the time. I’m very scared about different life in Philippines so I’m searching some review about that academy. Actually, I studied English REALLY painfully when I was 7~13 years old. It was really Sparuta!!! I thought I need to study another subjects too but my English homework was too much as a mountain. I don’t want to say more about my terrible life story. Anyway, I'm very scared about going to Philippines. But there is no way except this, so I should go and adapt that life.
